This is an unofficial powershell module to allow access to the Hudu API. I am not associated with Hudu other than as a customer.

Currently the API is missing some filtering options so I have had to implement them locally. This means especially the Get-HuduAssets command is very slow as no matter which options you specify it will have to download every asset and then filter it. I have a ticket with support to hopefully resolve this so I can fix it in a future version.

The filter options on get commands are all optional.

For more information on what Hudu provides and expects you can look at https://your.hudu.domain/developer/1.0/

Usage:
After installing the module you will need to run:
New-HuduAPIKey "YourKey"
New-HuduBaseURL "https://your.hudu.domain"

Currently implemented commands are:

New-HuduAPIKey
Get-HuduAPIKey
Remove-HuduAPIKey
New-HuduBaseURL
